For my Save Thai Ocean project, I designed a watercraft trash net attachment. The device solves the pain point of cruising along the river and craving to clean up floating trash but not having space for the garbage. This might change the perception of river clean-up to something fun!

Created using SolidWorks, Circular Cold Saw, Pipe Bender and TIG Welding Machine - Material: SUS 2B Stainless Steel Pipe
76.2 x 51.3 x 57 cm - Independent project
